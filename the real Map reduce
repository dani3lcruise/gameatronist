Map reduce also solves dimension reduction

consider n product dimension

x,y,z

Finding distance & clustering

100->3d

Map reduce - hdfs[Hadoop Distributed File system] - Parallel processing, Disturbuted processing

Diemension Reduction -> Redudancy parameter
1) Domain knowledge
2) Statistical Knowledge

Data Matrix = A -> High size
A = u epsilon v
